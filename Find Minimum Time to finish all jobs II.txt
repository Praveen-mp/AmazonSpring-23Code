You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays jobs and workers of equal length, where jobs[i] is the amount of time needed to complete the ith job, and workers[j] is the amount of time the jth worker can work each day.

Each job should be assigned to exactly one worker, such that each worker completes exactly one job.

Return the minimum number of days needed to complete all the jobs after assignment.
Input: jobs = [5,2,4], workers = [1,7,5]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Assign the 2nd worker to the 0th job. It takes them 1 day to finish the job.
- Assign the 0th worker to the 1st job. It takes them 2 days to finish the job.
- Assign the 1st worker to the 2nd job. It takes them 1 day to finish the job.
It takes 2 days for all the jobs to be completed, so return 2.
It can be proven that 2 days is the minimum number of days needed.

Code:
class Solution {
    public int minimumTime(int[] jobs, int[] workers) {
        Arrays.sort(jobs);
        Arrays.sort(workers);
        int min=0;
        
        for(int i=workers.length-1;i>-1;i--){
           int time=jobs[i]/workers[i];
            if(jobs[i]%workers[i]!=0){
               time++;
            }
            min=Math.max(time,min);
        }
        return min;
    }
}
