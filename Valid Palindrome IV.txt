You are given a 0-indexed string s consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can change any character of s to any other character.

Return true if you can make s a palindrome after performing exactly one or two operations, or return false otherwise.


Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdba"
Output: true
Explanation: One way to make s a palindrome using 1 operation is:
- Change s[2] to 'd'. Now, s = "abddba".
One operation could be performed to make s a palindrome so return true.

code:
class Solution {
    public boolean makePalindrome(String s) {
         int start=0;
         int end=s.length()-1;
         int count=0;
         while(start<end && (s.charAt(start)==s.charAt(end) || ++count<3)){
              start++;
              end--;
         }
         return count<3;
    }
}
